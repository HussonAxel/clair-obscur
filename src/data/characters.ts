    description:
      "Lune is a passionate Scholar and Mage who is in charge of charting a path for the 33rd Expedition. This gives her the weight of responsibility to make sure that the Expedition does not fail. She is the daughter of two prominent researchers, and she inherits her deep thirst for knowledge and discoveries. That being said, she will make sure and will sacrifice everything in order to complete her parents' work. Lune is the first character you find while exploring as Gustave at the beginning of the game. She accompanies Gustave to satisfy her curiosity about the Paintress. A unique detail about Lune is that when sprinting, instead of running on the ground, she will levitate and glide towards the direction you are controlling her in.",

      "Maelle is the foster sister of Gustave, though she is more of a shy loner, but is eager to fly; her reasoning to join the 33rd Expedition at the age of 16 is to explore the world outside of Lumiere. She was orphaned at the young age of 3 and has never felt like she fit in anywhere in Lumiere, but has a deep appreciation and trust towards Gustave. Maelle is the third character you find, as seen in the Demo of CO: E33. Gustave is eager to find Maelle when he hears that she is alive, but Lune believes it might be a trap.",
